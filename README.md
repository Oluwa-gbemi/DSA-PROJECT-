##  Findings & Recommendations

##  Key Findings

- Product Categories with the Highest Discounts
   * Categories like *Electronics* and *Fashion* had the most aggressive discounting, with many products offering 50% or more.

- Top-Rated Products
   * A few standout products achieved ratings above 4.8, indicating strong customer satisfaction. These often had high review counts as well, suggesting trust and popularity.

- Customer Engagement by Category
   * Categories such as *Books* and *Home & Kitchen* received the highest number of total reviews, reflecting high engagement.

- Average Discount by Category
   * Some categories consistently offered moderate discounts (\~20â€“30%), while others were polarized with either very low or very high discounts.

- Rating vs Discount
   * The relationship between discount levels and customer ratings showed that excessive discounting did not necessarily lead to higher ratings. Products with moderate discounts sometimes performed better in ratings.

- Pricing Buckets
   * Most products fell into the â‚¹200â€“â‚¹500 range, but the >â‚¹500 products generated higher potential revenue.

- Top 5 Products by Combined Popularity
   * By combining rating and review count, the top 5 products had both strong quality perception and high visibility.

##  Recommendations

- Focus Promotions on Mid-Tier Products
   * Products in the â‚¹200â€“â‚¹500 range performed best in volume. Consider bundling or upselling in this range.

- Use Customer Feedback to Improve Products in Low-Rating Categories
   * Categories with consistently low ratings should undergo quality reviews. Extract qualitative review insights to guide improvement.

- Avoid Over-Reliance on Deep Discounts
   * High discounts do not always yield better customer satisfaction. Test price elasticity to find optimal pricing.

- Leverage Top Products for Cross-Promotion
   * Best-rated and most-reviewed products can be used as hero products for marketing campaigns or cross-selling.

- Target High-Engagement Categories with More Inventory
   * Invest more in categories with high review counts â€” they show customer interest and potential for upsell.

- Use Rating Ã— Review Count as a Key Metric
   * This composite metric effectively reflects both product quality and reach â€” great for campaign targeting.
